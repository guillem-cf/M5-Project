# Cross-modal Retrieva

Scene understanding for autonomous driving is a crucial task that involves interpreting and analyzing the environment
around an autonomous vehicle. It requires the identification and classification of various objects, such as vehicles,
pedestrians, and road signs, as well as the estimation of their spatial and temporal relationships. The ability to
understand the scene is critical for an autonomous vehicle to make informed decisions and navigate safely and
efficiently. The development of advanced scene understanding algorithms is essential for the continued progress of
autonomous driving technology.
